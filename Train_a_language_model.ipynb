We could do it as a pre-processing step (like the tokenization) but then the tokens would always be masked the same way at each epoch.

The perplexity is much lower than for the CLM objective because for the MLM objective, we only have to make predictions for the masked tokens (which represent 15% of the total here) while having access to the rest of the tokens.
